# PYTHON-PROJECT-WITH-SQL-CONNECTIVITY
This project is based on the way in which the billing is  done in a fast food joint. The fast food joint database management  system is a software designed for the user to keep account of the  sales happening in a day. This is used to compute the amount of  sales and the profit or loss of the fast food joint for that particular  day.
The program is coded in python version 3.9.1 and data is defined in mySQL 8.0 command line client. The user takes in the query for each order and and appends the item ordered by the quantity ordered. A function is used to calculate the number of order, the total amount of sales and the profit earned by the manager per day. 
This function allows the user to append the items when an order is placed, delete when the order is cancelled and count the total amount of sales in that particular day. This function helps the user do his job in a much effective and easier way by the help of a program instead of pen and paper
