# PYTHON-PROJECT-WITH-SQL-CONNECTIVITY
This project is based on the way in which the billing is  done in a fast food joint. The fast food joint database management  system is a software designed for the user to keep account of the  sales happening in a day. This is used to compute the amount of  sales and the profit or loss of the fast food joint for that particular  day.
